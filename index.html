  <!-- MY STORY -->
  <section id="story">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
     My story begins in my hometown in New Jersey, shaped early by two defining forces: math and soccer. The first influence came from my mother: a Moroccan immigrant, a gifted mathematician, and an exceptional teacher. From day one, she taught me everything she knew. Having her as my first mentor was a true cheat code: not only did she make math intuitive and exciting, but her immigrant work ethic set a standard I learned to live by. Excellence was never optional; it was the expectation.
Math always came naturally, but the first time I truly felt the reward of disciplined effort was in sixth grade, when I placed first in my district in the NJ Math League competition. That moment mattered. My teacher pulled me aside and told me I should consider becoming an actuary. A seed was planted. I didn’t know then how far it would grow, but the direction was set. By seventh grade, I had mastered the math section of the SAT.
At the same time, soccer was my other passion. I had played for as long as I could remember, competing at the highest levels in New Jersey while staying ahead academically. Math and soccer weren’t competing interests; they reinforced each other. One trained my mind, the other my discipline.
When I moved to Texas my freshman year of high school, the environment changed, but the mentality did not. The competition, both academically and athletically was stronger. I played for FC Dallas and my high school varsity team while continuing to push academically, earning a perfect score on AP Calculus BC as a junior, scoring highly on AP Statistics as a senior, and performing strongly on the SAT. Even with a full schedule, I made time to give back. I tutored students of all ages in math and SAT preparation and trained young athletes in soccer. What started as helping others soon became something more meaningful. From apprentice to architect, I began building foundations for the next generation, offering the guidance I once sought and helping others surpass my own benchmarks.
I chose the University of Texas at Dallas to pursue Actuarial Science, a major that unified everything I had been building since childhood: mathematical rigor, structured problem-solving, and long-term thinking. The transition to college, however, was not smooth. I had 2 problems: First, I was facing an identity crisis. While I loved math and had a growing interest in financial risk and data analysis, the kid in me still held onto dreams of becoming a professional soccer player. Second, I was seeing math I had never seen before, and for the first time what had always felt effortless now demanded structure. Structure that I didn’t have.
Then came the turning point: I tore my ACL and meniscus. The universe has a way of easing our tough decisions; what felt like a "I've hit a wall” moment in my life turned out to be a pivotal redirection toward my true potential. 
During the eleven months away from soccer, I was forced to slow down and reassess. I taught myself how to study—truly study—and immersed myself in the actuarial world. I joined the Actuarial Club, attended company seminars, and began to see the depth and beauty of the profession. Over time, my emotional attachment shifted. Actuarial science became my intellectual passport. It opened doors to finance, programming, and deeper layers of statistics and calculus. I learned that every dataset carries a narrative, and the real challenge is learning how to read it forward. Math had always felt absolute—defined by right and wrong—but actuarial work lives in the gray. Using the past as evidence, there are infinitely many ways to model, stress, and shape what the future might look like.
I built my foundation during sophomore and junior year and fully capitalized on it as a senior. I applied my skills through hands-on projects in R, including a random forest tree simulator, built interactive dashboards in Tableau, and used SQL and Excel to clean, structure, and analyze data efficiently. Most importantly, I passed Actuarial Exams P and FM. Preparing for these exams elevated me to another level—teaching me how to manage time, work under pressure, and balance long-term goals with daily execution. From the outside, it looked like nonstop grinding. In reality, each exam sharpened my focus, strengthened my confidence, and created momentum. Once you pass one, you are driven to take the next. That is what I love about actuarial science: growth compounds quickly—across math, problem-solving, discipline, and career readiness.
College, like any real journey, was a series of rises and falls. I didn’t erase my mistakes; I built on them. Like the Fibonacci sequence, each step grew from the last, and only later did I recognize the pattern. The golden ratio became a personal reminder that growth is not linear—but when it compounds, it creates something balanced and intentional.
Since graduating, I have continued building: earning Coursera certifications, beginning preparation for my third actuarial exam, and taking on my most rewarding challenge yet—competing in an actuarial case competition where I calculated reserves using a hybrid Chain-Ladder and Bornhuetter–Ferguson approach. 
It is now 2026, and I am pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and AI, energized by the breadth of problems and industries ahead. This program allows me to deepen my technical foundation,strengthening my actuarial skill, while also expanding beyond traditional actuarial boundaries. I see this degree as a force multiplier. I am intentionally positioning myself to be versatile: prepared to grow as an actuary or to step into a new analytical domain if the opportunity demands it. I am motivated by learning, adaptable by design, and confident that wherever data, modeling, and decision-making intersect, I will add value and continue to grow. Thank you for reading my story!
