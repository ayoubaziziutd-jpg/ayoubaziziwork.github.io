  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <div class="card story">
    <p>My story begins in my hometown in New Jersey, shaped early by two defining forces: math and soccer. My first and most influential mentor was my mother—a Moroccan immigrant, a gifted mathematician, and an exceptional teacher. From day one, she taught me everything she knew. Having her as a guide was a true cheat code: she made math intuitive and exciting, and her immigrant work ethic instilled a standard I learned to live by early on. Excellence was never optional; it was the expectation.</p>

    <p>Math always came naturally, but the first time I truly felt the reward of disciplined effort was in sixth grade, when I placed first in my district in the NJ Math League competition. That moment mattered. A teacher pulled me aside and suggested I consider becoming an actuary. A seed was planted. I didn’t yet know how far it would grow, but the direction was set. By seventh grade, I had mastered the math section of the SAT.</p>

    <p>At the same time, soccer was my other passion. I had played for as long as I could remember, competing at the highest levels in New Jersey while staying ahead academically. Math and soccer were never competing interests; they reinforced one another. One trained my analytical thinking, the other built discipline, resilience, and focus.</p>

    <p>When I moved to Texas my freshman year of high school, the environment changed, but my mentality did not. The competition—both academically and athletically—was stronger. I played for FC Dallas and my high school varsity team while continuing to push academically, earning a perfect score on AP Calculus BC as a junior, scoring highly on AP Statistics as a senior, and performing strongly on the SAT. Even with a full schedule, I made time to give back—tutoring students of all ages in math and SAT preparation and training young athletes in soccer.</p>

    <p>I chose the University of Texas at Dallas to pursue Actuarial Science, a major that unified everything I had been building since childhood: mathematical rigor, structured problem-solving, and long-term thinking. The transition to college was not smooth. I faced an identity conflict and academic challenges that demanded structure I had not yet developed.</p>

    <p>Then came the turning point: I tore my ACL and meniscus. During the eleven months away from soccer, I slowed down, reassessed, and rebuilt. I taught myself how to study and immersed myself in the actuarial world—joining the Actuarial Club, attending company seminars, and discovering the depth of the profession.</p>

    <p>Actuarial science became my intellectual passport. It opened doors to finance, programming, and advanced statistics. I learned that every dataset carries a narrative, and the real challenge is learning how to read it forward. Using the past as evidence, there are infinitely many ways to model and shape the future.</p>

    <p>I built my foundation during sophomore and junior year and fully capitalized on it as a senior. I worked on hands-on projects in R, built dashboards in Tableau, and used SQL and Excel to structure data efficiently. Most importantly, I passed Actuarial Exams P and FM, developing discipline, confidence, and momentum.</p>

    <p>Since graduating, I have continued building—earning certifications, preparing for my third actuarial exam, and competing in an actuarial case competition using a hybrid Chain-Ladder and Bornhuetter–Ferguson reserving approach.</p>

    <p>It is now 2026, and I am pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and AI. This program strengthens my actuarial foundation while expanding my reach into advanced analytics and data science. I am intentionally positioning myself to be versatile—ready to grow as an actuary or pivot into broader analytics roles wherever opportunity and impact align.</p>
